In order to run this program, you should compile it by entering the 'make' command. Git was used as version control.
This will search the folder for .c files and compile them to their corresponding .o files
You can clean the directory and remove the .o files and executables using 'make clean'
The executable will be named 'bt'. Enter './bt -h' for a list of options to use with the program, or see below:

Usage: bt [directory_name] [-options]
                Options:
                       -h : Print help message
                       -L : Follow symbolic links
                       -t : Print file type
                       -p : Print permissions
                       -i : Print number of links in inode table
                       -u : Print the UID
                       -g : Print the GID
                       -s : Print file size
                       -d : Show time of last modification
		       -l : Outputs file info as if options -tpiugsd were all chosen

Problems encountered:

During development of this program, I ran into a lot of problems.

One example was when I was using ctime, and it was giving me unexpected behavior.
I realized that this was because I had not included the time.h header file, but it was still compiling and producing bad results.

Another problem that took me awhile was figuring out how to access files in another directory. Just using the stat struct, you are only given the filename,
and not the full/relative path. So I started appending the argument from the user onto the beginning of the path each time and storing that in my queue.
